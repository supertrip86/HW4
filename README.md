# Homework 4

### Group 22 - Eugenio Baldo, Giovanni Giunta, Leonardo Masci

The goal of this homework was to implement some algorithms and functions from scratch. The assignment comprised three separate topics:

- Exercise 1 had us working with hashing functions and the HyperLogLog algorithm, a state of the art algorithm for cardinality estimation;
- In exercise 2 we were asked to implement clustering on a given dataset and analyse the results in a variety of methods;
- The last exercise involved a purely theoretical question about sorting algorithms.

This repository consists of the following files, excluding this readme.md file:

1. __`main.ipynb`__: the main jupyter notebook, which includes all of our answers and comments.

2. __`functions.py`__: a file containing the functions used in the second exercise.

**NB**: the data we used are obscured through a .gitignore file
